Disclaimer, idk how to write a readme or if there are standards that I'm not following

Overall Purpose:
Generate linear task space trajectories from a starting position to an end position given arm lengths. Store those trajectories to files that are precalculated. Read those files. 


armKinematics.* is simple kinematics for a two jointed arm. Functions deal with converting xy coords to angles and vise-versa, as well as xy or angular velocities. 

Helpers.* and TrajectoryCalc.* are taken directly from last year's code. I don't even remember if I used noramlizeAngles from helpers here, but TrajectoryCalc is used to create a trapezoidal motion profile between two setpoints. (I'll give more details later on in this readme)

Source.cpp is really just to test. 

TaskSpaceTrajectoryCalc.* calculates a linear task space trajectory between a start point (given in angles of arms) and an end point, given in xy coordinates. I chose to have the start point given in angles so that there was no confusion as to whether to second joint starts bent up or down. 
This uses TrajcetoryCalc to figure out the linear position and velocity of the end effector between the two points as if the line is in 1d space. 
Some basic trig is then used to calculate the 2d linear position  and velocity. 
armKinematics is used to figure out the position and velocity of the joint angles, and this is outputted to create the profile. 

TwoJointArmProfiles.* reads profiles generated by TaskSpaceTrajectoryCalc and saves them to maps. The data structure of this is terrible and can be improved, but the purpose of this is so that the lengthy calculations of TaskSpaceTrajectoryCalc can be precalcualted and stored to files just as we did with our shot velocities and angles last year. 

All the .csv files are trajectories, and their numbers are the starting and ending positions. (check enum Positions for the order)
